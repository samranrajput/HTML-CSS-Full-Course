HTML Introduction:

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the foundational language used for structuring content on the web. HTML was introduced in 1991 by Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist, who had earlier developed the concept of the World Wide Web in 1989 while working at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research).

HTML allows developers to create structured web pages using elements like headings, paragraphs, images, links, lists, tables, and forms. It is not a programming language but a markup language that defines the layout and organization of content using tags such as <h1>, <p>, <a>, <img>, <div>, etc.

In addition to HTML, Tim Berners-Lee also developed HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) and the URL (Uniform Resource Locator), both of which are essential components for accessing and navigating the web.

Today, HTML is the first step into the world of web development. Whether you're becoming a front-end or full-stack developer, learning HTML is essential. When combined with CSS and JavaScript, HTML helps build visually appealing and interactive websites.
